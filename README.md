# üìö Book Rental System

A modern **Library Management System** built using the latest stack: **Laravel 12**, **Vue.js 3**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Inertia.js**.

The system is designed as an internal tool for small-scale library usage, where authenticated users can manage authors, books, and track the loan status of each book. The application uses a Single Page Application (SPA) approach for a fast and responsive user experience.

The project uses **MySQL/MariaDB** as the relational database, and leverages **Redis** for session/cache management in containerized environments with **Docker**. Testing is handled via **PHPUnit**, and static analysis is enforced with tools like **Larastan** and **PHP CS Fixer**.

This project includes automated PHPUnit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## üöÄ About the Project

This project represents a streamlined **book rental system** tailored for limited internal usage (e.g. school, company, or local library). It allows a predefined group of users (seeded via database) to log in, view and manage authors and books, and track which books are currently rented or available.

## üì• Install Project

To get started, follow these steps:

**1. Create the environment file:**
   - Run this command to clone the project:
     - `git clone https://github.com/Developer-Samuel/BookRental.git`

**2. Open the project directory:**
   - Change into the project folder:
     - `cd BookRental`
   - Or open the `BookRental` folder in your code editor/IDE.

## üß∞ Environment Setup

### üê≥ For Docker Development/Production

**1. (Optional) Clean up any running containers:**
  - `docker compose down -v --remove-orphans`

**2. Build and start Docker containers for setup:**
  - `docker compose --profile setup up --build`

**3. Run Docker containers normally:**
  - To run in the foreground (ideal for production testing or backend debugging):
    - `docker compose up`
  - To run in the background (recommended for production):
    - `docker compose up -d`

**4. Running Docker containers for development (frontend with Vite):**
  - To start services under the `dev` profile, run:
    - `docker compose --profile dev up`
  - You can add `-d` if you want to run detached:
    - `docker compose --profile dev up -d`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting permissions or log file issues

If you encounter permission problems or cannot find Laravel logs, execute the following commands **inside** the running app container:
  - `docker exec -it book_rental_app bash`
  - `ls -l /var/www/storage/logs/`
  - `cat /var/www/storage/logs/laravel.log`
  - `chmod -R 775 /var/www/storage`
  - `chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/storage /var/www/bootstrap/cache`
  - `exit`

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Development (XAMPP/YAMPP etc.)

**1. Create the environment file:**
   #### Choose the appropriate `.env` file based on your environment setup. 
   - Duplicate `env.example.local` and rename the copy to `.env` for production.
   - Duplicate `env.example.local.dev` and rename the copy to `.env` for development.

**2. Install dependencies:**
   - Run the following commands in your terminal:
     - `composer update`
     - `php artisan key:generate`
     - `npm install`

**3. Set up the database:**
   - Run migrations and seed the database with initial data by executing:
     - `php artisan migrate --seed`
       
**4. Run the project:**
   - Start the Laravel server by running:
     - `php artisan serve`
   - Start the development server for Vue.js and TypeScript by running:
     - `npm run dev`

**5. The project is now ready to use.**

##### üß™ Optional Development Tools

**6. Run tests (optional)**
   - To run the Laravel test suite, use:
     - `php artisan test`

**7. Run Larastan (optional)**
   - To perform static analysis using Larastan, run:
     - `composer analyse`

**8. Run PHP Fixer (optional)**
   - To automatically fix PHP coding style issues, run:
     - `composer fix`

## ‚úÖ Features

### üîê Secure Login
-  **Authentication** is restricted to pre-created users (seeded via DB).
-  **No public registration** - access is intended for authorized personnel only.
-  **Brute-force protection** - Login attempts are limited to 5 per minute per session, ensuring security without affecting other users on the same network.

### üìö Authors & Books CRUD
- Full **Create / Read / Update / Delete** operations for:
  - **Authors**
  - **Books**, each linked to an `author_id`.
- All books have a **loan status** tracked via a boolean field **is_borrowed** (0 = available, 1 = borrowed), indicating whether the book is currently rented..

### üßæ Book Rental Tracking
- Staff members can update book status manually to reflect real-world rentals.
- Simple, clear interface for checking which books are rented and which are available.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details
- Countries import and update is implemented as a scheduled Laravel command that fetches data from an external API and updates the database.
- Database migrations use Laravel macros and custom schema builders to ensure reusable and clean code.
- Caching leverages Laravel cache with expiration policies tuned for performance.

### Tests Directory
- `tests/Feature`  

  High-level tests simulating real-world user interactions and full request flows.  
  This suite covers critical application workflows and ensures the system behaves correctly from end to end.  

  **Key areas tested here include:**
  - **Commands**: Tests for custom Artisan commands verifying their execution and side effects.  
  - **Core**: Tests for foundational reusable functions and utilities that underpin various features, ensuring consistent behavior.  
  - **Http\Controllers**: Tests focused on controller logic, validating request handling, response status codes, authorization, and input validation.

- `tests/Unit`  

  Fine-grained, low-level tests aimed at individual classes, methods, and business logic units.  
  This layer guarantees that core components behave predictably in isolation.  

  **Principal components covered:**
  - **Core\Controllers** and **Core\Traits**: Testing reusable traits and base controller logic to ensure DRY principles and robust abstractions.  
  - **Repositories**: Validating data access layers, query logic, and correct interaction with the persistence layer.  
  - **Services**: Ensuring business logic services function correctly, handle edge cases, and enforce domain rules reliably.

This dual-level testing strategy balances integration-style feature tests with rigorous unit tests to achieve maximum coverage, maintainability, and confidence in the system's correctness, following best practices and industry standards.
